        the ground? Remember the top 8? We chose our top 8 friends and made it
        public. If you were friend number 9...too bad. We were a proper country

          <p>Hello 👋 My name is Jim and I'm a software developer.</p>
          <p>
            I live in Mesa, AZ with my family (see the 👦🏼 👩🏻 👦🏻) and I grew up
            near St. Louis. I took an unusual path to software development...
            after 10 years in creative marketing, I was laid off during the
            pandemic. In between applications and job searching, I spent my free
            time learning to code and decided to officially change careers. I
            started a software engineering program (see 🎓 🤖) and left
            marketing behind for good.

          <h3>March 2024 - Present</h3>
          <p>
            Showit is a no-code, drag-and-drop website builder. I'm a software
            developer on the Applications team, which mostly focuses on our
            Design App, the platform where users design, publish, and manage
            their websites.
          </p>
          <p>Some highlights of my time at Showit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Deployed a complete UI overhaul of the Design App, which
              introduced reusable web components and a new design system to
              bring together a cohesive user experience across the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a custom buttons interface that allows users to create and
              standardize site buttons without having to group custom elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed a drag-and-drop interface to add images directly from
              file system to design canvas.

          <p>
            From 2016-2020, I dabbled in content creation and started an
            outdoors hiking/camping/backpacking blog and YouTube channel. It
            didn't exactly go viral, but there were a few notable hits. Some of
            my content on popular Arizona destinations like West Clear Creek
            (see video) and Reavis Ranch were at the top of Google search
            results. I also had the chance to review some North Face gear for
            its official site. All-in-all, it was a fun era of my life and a
            great way to flex some creativity while doing what I love outside.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Before coding, or even marketing, I wanted to be a journalist. I was
            a writer and editor for my college newspaper, The Murray State News,
            and interned as a crime/fire beat reporter for the New Era in
            Hopkinsville, KY.

          <h3>Hack Reactor | Software Engineering (2021)</h3>
          <p>
            Hack Reactor was a 16-week marathon of full-time programming
            education...7 days a week, 11-12 hours a day. There's a good reason
            it's called an "immersive" and it was the best way for me to learn
            programming in such a short window. We covered computer science
            fundamentals, algorithms and data structures, front-end web
            development with React, and back-end web development with Node.js.

          <h3>May 2021 - February 2024</h3>
          <p>
            My career in programming started at a sports data company where I
            was a full-stack developer working on React web tools, analytics
            dashboards, and two Node.js API servers that managed millions of
            requests, emails, sms messages, and AI-powered sports content.

          <p>Some highlights of my time at FanPower:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Led design and deployment of an AI-driven sports content platform,
              generating thousands of articles and polls from live sports data
              using LLM integration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engineered scalable architecture that tripled API response speeds
              with Redis caching and eliminated timeout errors, improving
              deployment reliability to nearly 100%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Orchestrated company-wide rebranding with a new design system and
              reusable React components, plus built an admin portal that doubled
              productivity.

            As Content Producer, I was responsible for online materials such as

            As copywriter, wrote for print, web, event signage, product labels,

          <h3>Clearvoice | Content Strategist</h3>
          <p>
            I started at Clearvoice as an outreach specialist but moved into a
            writing role when content marketing took off as a trend in SEO.
            During that time, I wrote hundreds of blog posts and social media

            websites with plain HTML and it inspired me to step away from React

          <ul>
            <li>A single HTML file</li>
            <li>CSS with no pre- or post-processors</li>
            <li>
              Some JavaScript logic to handle the bento grid tilting and gloss
              effects
            </li>
            <li>And that's it!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No frameworks, no libraries, no bundlers or imports... just a static
