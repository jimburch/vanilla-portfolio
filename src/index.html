        Yooooooo it's a scrolling marquee. Do you remember this? Do you remember
        GeoCities and their scrolling marquees? We probably had them on MySpace
        too. Remember how the custom HTML and CSS would melt our computers to
        the ground? Remember the top 8? We chose our top 8 friends and made it
        public. If you were friend number 9...too bad. We were a proper country
        back then.
